Project 3: Conduct a security audit

    Description: In this project, I reviewed the scope, goals, and risk assessment report details for Botium Toys and used the information to run through a controls and compliance checklist. By reviewing the risk assessment
    report, I was able to identify signs of a weak security posture and provide recommendations on how to strengthen that posture.
    Technologies Used: Security audit process
    Highlights: Am now comfortable reviewing a risk assessment report and outlining the scope and goals for such a report.
